# LapisCore
A powerful core library for Spigot plugins, this is used for most of my larger plugins since it gives me a platform to build off of.

If you think it should have any extra features or you encounter a bug, make an issue and I'll do my best to make it happen

# Getting the API
The LapisCore API is on Maven Central.
Simply use the LapisCore dependency and Maven will fetch the API

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.lapismc</groupId>
  <artifactId>LapisCore</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.2</version>
</dependency>
```
